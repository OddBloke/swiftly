swiftly (2.01) In Progress

    * Added the ability to use a configuration file for the various main
      options. See the swiftly.conf-sample for what's available. You can use
      the default location of ~/.swiftly.conf or specify a conf file with the
      --conf <path> option.

    * Made all main options also available from setting os environment
      variables. Command line options override environment variables which
      override conf file values.

    * Added an --until-empty option to delete --recursive to keep making passes
      trying to delete everything from stubborn containers, such as those with
      object versioning turned on. Run `swiftly help delete` for more details.

    * If a region is not specified and a default region is not indicated by the
      auth system, the first available region will now be selected. Thanks to
      David Cole for this one.

    * Fixed a bug in DirectClient and StandardClient streaming support.

    * Made Concurrency sleep (yield) right after a spawn to give the new
      coroutine a chance to get started before launching yet more coroutines.

    * Added a LocalClient selectable on the CLI with -L <path> or --local
      <path> option. This local client just fakes a Swift cluster, storing the
      data on the local file system. Experimental but could be useful for
      testing.

    * Made LocalMemcache a Brim.Net Core Package WSGI compatible app.
      http://github.com/gholt/brim
      It remains Swift WSGI compatible for use in direct mode.

    * Made StandardClient throw away connections that have been unused for more
      than 4 seconds as most servers drop Keep Alive connections after 5
      anyway. Should reduce the try/get-an-error/retry sequences.

    * Enhanced the CLI to be extendable. See http://github.com/gholt/brimlock/
      for an example of a CLI tool that just extends Swiftly.

    * Added the --no-snet --no-cache-auth --no-cdn and --no-verbose options to
      turn off the associated values from the conf file or os environment.

    * Finally started a CHANGELOG.
