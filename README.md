# Swiftly - A client for Swift

Provides a Client class and a command line tool for common Swift functions.
Works both with access as a standard external user and as an internal
administrator of a cluster with direct access to the rings and to all back end
servers.

You can read the Sphinx-built documentation at
<http://gholt.github.io/swiftly/>.

**NOTE**: The master branch is current dev work. Depending on how adventurous
you are, you might want to switch to the "stable" branch if you're running from
a git clone.
